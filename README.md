As you complete each lab, you should provide a description of your features and changes here.


## VR Lab 1: Apple Orchard Work
The player will collect two apples from the tree and place them on the barrel. I only used assets from VRTK's Farm scene. To demonstrate that the user has completed the task, the directions will change to a message that states you have finished.
