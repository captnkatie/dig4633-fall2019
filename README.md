As you complete each lab, you should provide a description of your features and changes here.


## VR Lab 1: Apple Orchard Work
The player will collect two apples from the tree and place them on the barrel. I only used assets from VRTK's Farm scene. To demonstrate that the user has completed the task, the directions will change to a message that states you have finished.

## AR Lab 2: Mummy Character Editor
The potential app concept that I developed is a character editor. The player would be able to create their character in AR-mode and add/remove accessories and different designs to customize their character. This could be used in a multitude of games to allow for interesting interactive experiences with the characters and the creation process. A game that does this similarly is the app Pokemon Go, which allows you to view caught creatures live in AR and watch them idle and click on them to have them perform an animation. This allows you to create interesting pictures with Pokemon in the real world. An experience where you could create a character and then pose it within the real world offers new experiences for players.
